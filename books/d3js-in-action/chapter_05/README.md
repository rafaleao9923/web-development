# Pie and stack layouts
This folder contains the exercise files for chapter 5 of [D3.js in Action, 3rd edition](https://www.manning.com/books/d3js-in-action-third-edition).
</br>
The folder is separated into subfolders corresponding to each section of the chapter. In these subfolders, you'll find a *start* and an *end* folder. To follow along with the book's instructions, write your code in the *start* folder. You'll find the solution in the *end* folder if ever you get stuck.
When changing to the next section, you can choose to keep coding in the same files or use the *start* folder for that section.

## Sections in this chapter
* [5.1-Pie_layout](https://github.com/d3js-in-action-third-edition/code-files/tree/main/chapter_05/5.1-Pie_layout)
* [5.2-Stack_layout](https://github.com/d3js-in-action-third-edition/code-files/tree/main/chapter_05/5.2-Stack_layout)
* [5.3-Legend](https://github.com/d3js-in-action-third-edition/code-files/tree/main/chapter_05/5.3-Legend)

## How to run the project
To run this project, you'll need a local webserver. We recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)'s Live Server extension. You can find instructions on installing this extension in Appendix A of the book.
1. Open the project folder (a *start* OR an *end* folder from the subsections mentioned above) in VS Code.
2. To run the project with the Live Server extension, click the *Go live* button in the status bar of VS Code.
3. The project should open automatically in your browser.

## Structure of the project
* The `/data` folder contains the CSV file `data.csv`, listing the sales revenue from different music formats between 1973 and 2019. The revenues are in million USD and adjusted for inflation (2017).
    * The music formats are `vinyl`, `8-track`, `cassette`, `cd`, `download`, and `streaming`.
    * The category `other` includes revenues from music videos (physical), synchronization, and royalties.
* The `/css` folder contains two CSS files:
    * `base.css` consists of the generic styles applied to the project page, like the font, spacings, and colors. Although you wonâ€™t need to edit this file, feel free to personalize it!
    * `visualization.css` is where we will add styles for our visualizations. It already contains the style properties applied to responsive SVG containers, following the strategy described in chapter 1.
* The `/js` folder contains multiple JavaScript files. Since we will work on three different charts, separating our code into different files will make it easier to understand, write and maintain. We also have files that handle the constants and functions shared by multiple charts, like margins and scales.
    * `shared-constants.js` contains each chart's margins, width, and height, as per the strategy discussed in chapter 4. It also includes an array named `formatsInfo` that lists the id, label, and color associated with each format.
    * `scales.js` is where you'll initialize the D3 scales used to create each visualization.
    * `donut-charts.js` is where you'll generate the donut charts.
    * `stacked-bars.js` is where you'll generate the stacked bar chart.
    * `streamgraph.js` is where you'll generate the streamgraph.
    * `legend.js` is where you'll create the legend.
    * `load-data.js` is where the data is loaded and passed to the different functions that generate the visualizations.
* `index.html` contains the markup and text that composes the project. The D3 library, the CSS files, and the JavaScript files are already loaded in `index.html`.

Happy D3 coding! ðŸ¤“
