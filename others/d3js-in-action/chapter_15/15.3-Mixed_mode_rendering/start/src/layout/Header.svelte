          A closer look at Vincent van Gogh's artistic production during the
          last ten years of his life.

        <p class="introduction">
          Vincent van Gogh produced most of his artwork within only a few years.
          We are all familiar with his paintings, which he created about a
          thousand, and his drawings. But few know about all the 820 letters he
          wrote, primarily to his brother Theo, which are an integral part of
          his artistic legacy. In this visualization, we explore van Gogh's
          artistic production (paintings, drawings, and letters) every month
          between 1881 and 1890.
